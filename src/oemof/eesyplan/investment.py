def crf(duration, discount_factor):

    Calculates the capital recovery factor which is used to convert a one-time
    investment into an equivalent annual cost over a given duration

    Parameters
    ----------
    duration : int
        Time period of the series of equal payments (usually equal asset lifetime)
    discount_factor : float
        Weighted average cost of capital, which is the after-tax average cost
        of various capital sources

    Returns
    -------
    float : CRF capital recovery factor, used to convert a one-time
    investment into an equivalent annual cost over a given duration

    Examples
    --------
    >>> round(crf(10, 0.05), 5)
